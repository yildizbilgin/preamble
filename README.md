# Preamble Synchronization

•This project investigates the detection, classification, frame synchronization, and demodulation of wireless networkingwaveforms by a digital receiver.

•To do this, preamble structure is used.

•Three commercial wireless networking standards- IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b, and IEEE 802.16 are developed

•Firstly, to understand which preamble we used, cross correlation is done

•Secondly, there should be a decision threshold to distinguish between signal and noise, and it is used in signal detection.

•At the end of the project, we’ll reach the ability to signal detection and frame synchronization of multiple wireless networking waveforms.
